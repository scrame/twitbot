Twitbot is just a stupid automated twitter script to make humorous comments. I dont expect anyone to use it other than me, and it will not be posting to my main twitter feed. So whatever.

It works like this (so far):

The environment variables:
twitbot_user
and 
twitbot_pass
configure the user name and password for the bot to post to.
