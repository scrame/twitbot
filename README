Twitbot is just a stupid automated twitter script to make humorous comments. I dont expect anyone to use it other than me, and it will not be posting to my main twitter feed. So whatever.

It has a dependency on Net::Twitter from cpan, on debian I was able to install this by just typing:

 sudo cpan Net::Twitter

Your method may vary, but its necessary, and that has a full dependency on Moose and a few other things, too. I didn't say this was packaged for general consumption.

Currently it just runs a single piece that logs in and posts the first thing passed in. Like so:

 ./twitbotd 'this is a test message'

If this is your first time running, it will ask you to paste a link into your browser to properly authenticate you. Its a little clunky, but not difficult. Give it a shot.
